# Hyperdimensional Computing for Dynamic Vision Sensor's Data

These files let you help handling DVS data.


## Usage

### process_dvs_data.py
Uses functions from helper_functions.py to first create the hypervectors of the item memory and then train class vectors with them. Afterwords, these are tested against test data.

### create_video.py
Let's you create a frame-based video from the event data

### plot_event_rate.py
Gives you the events per microsecond on the sensor. Expect high activity.
